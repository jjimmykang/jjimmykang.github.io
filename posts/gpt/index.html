  Overview
  <a class="anchor" href="#overview">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I implemented a character-level transformer in PyTorch, trained on <a href="https://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata.html">enwik9</a>.</p>
<p>My main goals with this project were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brush up on PyTorch.</li>
<li>Make sure I could rederive important parts of Transformer math from scratch.</li>
<li>Get into the groove of using my RTX 4090 with any future experiments that I might want to try.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is in my <a href="https://github.com/jjimmykang/ml/blob/master/gpt/Transformer.ipynb">repo</a>, as any future work will be.
There are many explanations of the transformer mechanism (<a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/">Illustrated Transformer</a> is a good one),
so these are just my notes rather than anything comprehensive.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="final-results">
  Final Results
  <a class="anchor" href="#final-results">#</a>
</h2>
<p>After a half day of training, the model was trained on 7,372,800,000 characters.
I got this number by just doing $\text{batch size} \cdot \text{ctx len} \cdot \text{train steps}$.
Perhaps this is wrong if anyone wants to enlighten me.
The model achieved a validation perplexity of 2.35.</p>
<p>The results are interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prompt: OpenAI is<br>
Completion: OpenAI is built at a time under the shuffly falling this [[supervised aircraft]] and [[attack]]s, over which the weapons controls exercise, extend out to CPU&rsquo;s abmies and Fermi-mantinei missariens at Rotary Pl</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Prompt: Traditional film school<br>
Completion: Traditional film school adaptations to the British to broad dinners and rituals, and an infix &lsquo;ge:gez.php.&rsquo;. Reasonably, the high priest mother has such a personality, it is not fit in favor of his factory, such as Gabriel</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly nonsensical, but there is readable grammar and even some topic consistency.
The model maintained coherence with words like aircraft, attack, weapons, and CPU for example.</p>

  The Softmax Formula In Attention
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-softmax-formula-in-attention">#</a>
</h3>
<p>$$ \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}} Q K^T\right) $$
Something that wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious to me at first was why we divide the dot product by $\sqrt{d_k}$ in self attention.
Like a lot of things, it&rsquo;s to improve stability of training and keep gradients from vanishing or exploding.</p>
<p>As a narrow example, assume that $q$ and $k$ are i.i.d. with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
Then, $\text{Var}(q^T k) = \sum_{i=1}^{d_k} \sigma^2 \cdot \sigma^2 = d_k \sigma^4 \rightarrow \text{Std}(q^T k) = \sqrt{d_k} \sigma^2$.
The division gets rid of the $\sqrt{d_k}$ term so that our variance is constant regardless of our key dimension.
From what I understand this intuition extends to actual $q$ and $k$ vectors, keeping them well conditioned.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="multi-head-attention">
  Multi-Head Attention
  <a class="anchor" href="#multi-head-attention">#</a>
</h3>
<p>A limitation of the basic single-head attention mechanism is that it forces every token interaction to pass through one shared metric of similarity.
The word &ldquo;book&rdquo; may mean different things depending on the context, such as &ldquo;booking a flight&rdquo;, &ldquo;reading a book&rdquo;, or &ldquo;booking it out of here.&rdquo;
Even though it may be possible for us to learn these different meanings with a wide enough key dimension and/or increasing of other parameters,
multi-head attention allows us to factorize the problem so that the treatments are disentangled.
And also every paper I could find since 2017 used MHA.</p>
<p>Concretely, consider the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, League of Legends professional Faker <em>played</em> &hellip;</p></blockquote>
<p>Suppose our model must guess the word &ldquo;played.&rdquo;
It must listen to the token(s) &ldquo;League of Legends&rdquo; to deduce that Faker will play a video game.
But it must also definitely pay attention to &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo; to decide the tense of the verb.
These are different attention patterns which we hope to capture with multiple heads.</p>
<p>Although I&rsquo;m not sure how much this matters, because we concatenate the output of the different heads,
the output vector of the MHA block is also semantically partitioned.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="position-encodings">
  Position Encodings
  <a class="anchor" href="#position-encodings">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Attention is a set operation.
If we don&rsquo;t encode position, the network would not know the order of the words.
For my implementation I just added <code>self.pos_emb = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(ctx_len, d_model))</code> and this worked fine.
In practice people use sinusoidal or rotary embeddings but I didn&rsquo;t do that for this tiny model.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="the-maskfalse-incident">
  The mask=False incident
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-maskfalse-incident">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The first time I tried to train the network, I set up the notebook and left for the day.
I came back 14 hours later to find that I had trained without the self-attention mask, leading to nonsensical generations.</p>
<p>Even for this small exercise, there was a big change in pace from my regular work.
Normally data and program behavior are <em>interpretable</em> for me.
Working in a traditional regression setting allows me to iterate on relatively trivial errors very quickly.
Fitting takes way less time than deep learning jobs and bugs are easy to catch early on.
The feedback loop is just much longer even for a small project like this, on the order of hours rather than seconds and I can only imagine that it is worse for production workloads.</p>
